      An ROSpec is a "Reader Operation Specification", i.e.,
      a declarative description of when and how
      a reader should turn on its antennas and report data.
      It's passed via EdgeX as a JSON object.

    description: >-
      An ROAccessReport is the main report type in LLRP.
      They contain the TagReportData or RFSurveyReportData,
      as well as any Custom parameter data.

    name: "ReaderEventNotification"
    description: >-
      Readers generate Reader Event Notifications for a variety of events,
      including changes in connectivity, antenna additions/removals,
      GPIO state changes, new report data, and exception events.
      Some event notifications are configurable.

    description: >-
      EdgeX's Device Service SDK only distinguishes between "GET" and "PUT",
      and all PUT parameters must be defined deviceResources.
      Since we won't have, e.g., information about the HTTP path used in a request,
      this resource exists only to distinguish actions to take on other resources.
